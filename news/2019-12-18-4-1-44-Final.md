I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.44.Final after almost 2 months of work. This is a bug-fix release which fixes some critical issues. Please upgrade as soon as possible.

For more details please read-on.

The most important changes in this release are:

* Detect missing colon when parsing http headers with no value ([#9871](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9871))

* Don't send window update frame for unconsumed bytes when stream is already closed ([#9816](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9816))
* Correctly set writerIndex when EpollChannelOption.MAX_DATAGRAM_PAYLOAD_SIZE is used in all cases ([#9819](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9819))
* Correctly guard against multiple RST frames for the same stream ([#9811](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9811))
