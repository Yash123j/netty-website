I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.38.Final. This is a bug-fix release but also contains a few performance enhancements. 

The most important changes in this release are:

* Prevent ByteToMessageDecoder from overreading when !isAutoRead ([#9252](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9252))
* Http2FrameCodecBuilder.autoAckSettingsFrame(...) must be public ([#9295](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9295))
* Disable Huffman encoding for small headers ([#9269](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9269))
* Use Table lookup for HPACK decoder ([#9307](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9307))
* Correctly take length of ByteBufInputStream into account for readLine() / readByte() ([#9310](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9310))
* Pre-decompressed DNS record RData that may contain compression pointers ([#9311](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9311))
* Fixed incorrect Sec-WebSocket-Origin header for v13, see #9134 ([#9312](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9312))
* Correctly handle http2 upgrades when Http2FrameCodec is used together with Http2MultiplexHandler ([#9318](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9318))
* Fix NPE caused by re-entrance calls in FlowControlHandler ([#9320](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9320))
* Allow to disable automatically sending PING acks ([#9338](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9338))
* HTTP2: Always apply the graceful shutdown timeout if configured ([#9340](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9340))
* DecoratingHttp2ConnectionEncoder.consumeReceivedSettings must not throw if delegate is instance of Http2SettingsReceivedConsumer ([#9343](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9343))
* Fix epoll spliceTo file descriptor with offset ([#9369](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9369))
* Fix an NPE in AbstractHttp2StreamChannel ([#9379](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9379))
* HTTP/2 multiplex: Correctly process buffered inbound data even if autoRead is false ([#9389](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9389))
* availableSharedCapacity will be slowly exhausted ([#9394](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9394))
* HTTP/2: Ensure newStream() is called only once per connection upgrade and the correct handler is used ([#9396](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9396))
