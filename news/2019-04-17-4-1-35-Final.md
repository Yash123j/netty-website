Today we announce the release of netty 4.1.35.Final. This release contains mostly bugfixes, some improvements and a few performance wins.
If you use netty-tcnative or netty-tcnative-boringssl-static you also need to upgrade to 2.0.25.Final.

The most important changes in this release are:

* Only try to use OpenSslX509TrustManagerWrapper when using Java 7+ ([#9065](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9065))
* DnsNameResolver.resolve(...) should notify future as soon as one preferred record was resolved ([#9050](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9050))
* Correctly calculate ttl for AuthoritativeNameServer when update existing records ([#9051](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9051))
* DnsNameResolver.resolveAll(...) should also contain non preferred addresses ([#9044](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9044))
* Websocket client closing handshake to support "force close" after given timeout ([#8883](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8883))
* Correctly handle overflow in Native.kevent(...) when EINTR is detected ([#9024](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9024))
* DnsNameResolver.resolveAll(...) should not include duplicates ([#9021](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9021))
* Skip execution of Channel*Handler method if annotated with @Skip and just use the next handler in the pipeline ([#8988](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8988))
* Allow to offload / customize key signing operations when using BoringSSL ([#8943](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8943))
* Allow to offload certificate validation when using BoringSSL ([#8974](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8974))
* Add user possibility to skip the evaluation of a certain websocket extensions ([#8910](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8910))
* Don't try to put back MemoryRegionCache.Entry objects into the Recycler when recycled because of a finalizer ([#8955](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8955))
* Fix possible ByteBuf leak when CompositeByteBuf is resized ([#8946](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8946))
* Allow to automatically trim the PoolThreadCache in a timely interval ([#8941](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8941))
* Support ALLOW_HALF_CLOSURE channel option on Unix domain socket. ([#8932](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8932))
* Correctly produce ssl alert when certificate validation fails on the client-side when using native SSL implementation ([#8949](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8949))
* Fix HttpUtil.isKeepAlive to behave correctly when Connection is a comma separated list defect ([#8924](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8924))

# Notes about new features / improvements

This section contains some details about some changes that deserve a bit more attentions. Please check the related PRs for even more details.

## Offload various handshake related operations from the EventLoop

This release added various features related to offload handshake related operations from the EventLoop when netty-tcnative-boringssl-static is used. This can be very helpfully if you need to do any blocking operation in your `KeyManager` or `TrustManager` implementation. As these are still considered as "experimental" as these were just added you explicit need to enable the offloading via `-Dio.netty.handler.ssl.openssl.useTasks=true`. 

Beside this you will need to use the `SslContext` methods that take another Executor in its parameters.

* Allow to offload certificate validation when using BoringSSL ([#8974](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8974))

## Offload key signing operations

When using netty-tcnative-boringssl-static it is now possible to offload the key-signing completely (a.k.a keyless SSL). This can be done by implementations `OpenSslPrivateKeyMethod` and set your implementation via `ReferenceCountedOpenSslContext.setPrivateKeyMethod(...)`. 

Please note that this feature is still considered experimental and so is marked with `@UnstableApi`.

For more details see ([#8943](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8943)).

## Performance improvements when using BoringSSL

We now use [CRYPTO_BUFFER](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/chromium-stable/PORTING.md#crypto_buffer) when netty-tcnative-boringssl-static is used which allows us to remove the overhead of multiple parsing operations related to the certificate chain. 

For more details see ([#455](https://github.com/netty/netty-tcnative/pull/445)).
