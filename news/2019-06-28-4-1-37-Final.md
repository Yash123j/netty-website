* Try to mark child channel writable again once the parent channel becomes writable ([#9254](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9254))
* WebSocket is closed without an error on protocol violations ([#9116](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9116))
* Writability state of http2 child channels should be decoupled from the flow-controller ([#9235](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9235))
* Fix LZ4 encoder/decoder performance with (default) xxHash32 ([#9249](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9249))

* Fix possible unsafe sharing of internal NIO buffer in CompositeByteBuf ([#9169](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9169))
* KQueueEventLoop won't unregister active channels reusing a file descriptor ([#9149](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9149))
* Prefer direct io buffers if direct buffers pooled ([#9167](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9167))
* Add support for TCP fallback when we receive a truncated DnsResponse ([#9139](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9139))

# Important notes

Some of the changes done in the release deserve some more explantion. This section lists all of these.

# `Http2MultiplexCodec*` deprecation

If you used `Http2MultiplexCodec*` in the past you will notice that `Http2MultiplexCode` and `Http2MultiplexCodecBuilder` are marked as `@deprecated` in this release. The reason for this is that how it was implemented did result in a too tight coupling of `Http2FrameCodec` and `Http2MultplexCodec` which made it impossible to add special handling of frames before these are multiplexed to the `Http2StreamChannel`s. 

As a replacement we now offer `Http2MultiplexHandler` which only has the responsible of multiplexing and nothing more. This means that instead of having only `Http2MultiplexCodec` in the `ChannelPipeline` you will now need to add `Http2FrameCodec` and `Http2MultiplexHandler` to the pipeline.

As an example this is how your "old" code may look as of today:

```java
ChannelPipeline pipeline = ...
pipeline.addLast(Http2MultiplexCodecBuilder.forServer(new HelloWorldHttp2Handler()).build());
...
```

In the future it should be changed to:

```java
ChannelPipeline pipeline = ...
pipeline.addLast(Http2FrameCodecBuilder.forServer().build());
pipeline.addLast(new Http2MultiplexHandler(new HelloWorldHttp2Handler());
...
```

While the semantics of the child channels ( `Http2StreamChannel` ) are mostly unchanged `Http2MultiplexHandler` changes 2 things to make it easier for users to re-use code between `HTTP/1` and `HTTP/2`:
* `Http2ResetFrame`s are propagated to the `Http2StreamChannel` as an user-event as these should not be affected on `AutoRead` configurations of the child-channels and the user should be able to receive them ASAP (even if the user stopped reading for back-pressure reasons).
* `Http2WindowUpdateFrame`s are not propagated as these are not meaningful to the `Http2StreamChannel` and just make writing generic code more difficult

The old `Http2MultiplexCodec` behave the same as before to not affect people that depend on the behavior.

# DnsNameResolver TCP fallback

As defined by RFC7766(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7766) resolvers should support TCP fallback in case the response is too large and so is truncated. This release add support for TCP fallback if you configure your `DnsNameResolverBuilder` to do so before building the final `DnsNameResolver`.

For example this code doesn't use TCP fallback (old behavior):

```java
DnsNameResolver resolver = new DnsNameResolverBuilder(eventLoop)
        .channelType(NioDatagramChannel.class).build();
...
```

To enable TCP fallback specify `socketChannelType`:

```java
DnsNameResolver resolver = new DnsNameResolverBuilder(eventLoop)
        .channelType(NioDatagramChannel.class)
        .socketChannelType(NioSocketChannel.class).build();
...
```
