title: 'Netty 4.1.48.Final released'

I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.48.Final shortly after our last release. We decided to release this fast to be able to provide support for `SameSite` as fast as possible as more and more browsers are depending on it and also to ensure `HttpObjectDecoder` will limit the number of control-chars prior to parsing the initial line. If you use the HTTP/1.x codec of Netty please upgrade as soon as possible.

The most important changes in this release are:

* HttpObjectDecoder should limit the number of control chars ([#10112](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10112))
* Close SocketChannel upon exceptions to avoid leaking ([#10110](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10110))
* Ensure WebSocket*Handshaker can not corrupt pipeline when HttpProxyHandler is used ([#10103](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10103))
* Fix WebSocketClientHandshaker not generating correct handshake request when path is empty ([#10095](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10095))
* Added support for the SameSite attribute in Cookies ([#10050](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10050))

For the details and all changes, please browse our issue tracker for [4.1.48.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.1.48.Final). 


## Details

### SameSite attribute

As we are not able to break APIs until we release a new major version we couldn't add support for `SameSite` attribute to the `Cookie` interface itself and so you can only set it on `DefaultCookie` itself.

For more details on what this is all about please have a look at the [related RFC section](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-05#section-5.3.7).
