I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.42.Final. This is a bug-fix release but also contains a few performance enhancements and features. 

For more details please read-on.

The most important changes in this release are:

* Correctly reset cached local and remote address when disconnect() is called ([#9545](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9545))
* Correctly synchronize before trying to set key material to fix possible native crash ([#9566](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9566))
* Correctly handle task offloading when using BoringSSL / OpenSSL ([#9575](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9575))
* Fix possible infinite while loop in NonStickyEventExecutorGroup due misusage of MPSC queue ([#9579](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9579))
* Correctly handle whitespaces in HTTP header names as defined by RFC7230#section-3.2.4 ([#9585](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9585))
* Close eventfd shutdown/wakeup race by closely tracking epoll edges ([#9586](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9586))
* Fix GraalVM native image build error ([#9593](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9593))
* We need to use NewGloblRef when caching jclass instances ([#9595](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9595))
* Cleanup JNI code to always correctly free memory when loading fails and also correctly respect out of memory in all cases ([#9596](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9596))
