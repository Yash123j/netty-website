* Add SslHandshakeTimeoutException and use it for handshake timeouts ([#10062](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10062))
* Correctly calculate the produced bytes in all cases when calling ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine.wrap(...) ([#10063](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10063))
* More strict parsing of initial line / http headers ([#10058](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10058))
* Correctly handle lifecycle of clientHello ByteBuf in SslClientHelloHandler ([#10030](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10030)) 
* HTTP/2 child channel may discard flush when done from an arbitrary thread ([#10019](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10019)) 
* Remove "Content-Length" when decoding HTTP/1.1 message with both "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" and "Content-Length" ([#10003](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10003))

* Add SslClientHelloHandler which allows to do something based on the SSL ClientHello ([#9827](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/9827))
