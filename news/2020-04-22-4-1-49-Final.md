* SslHandler should fail handshake / close promise and notify pipeline on removal ([#10161](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10161))
* Replace usage() with freeBytes() in thresholds within hot paths of PoolChunkList ([#10141](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10141))
* Introduce DomainWildcardMappingBuilder to fix wildcard matching according to RFC6125 ([#10132](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10132))
