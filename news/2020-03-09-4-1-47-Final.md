I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.47.Final, just 1,5 weeks after our last release. This releases fixes an issue which could cause WINDOW_UPDATE_FRAMEs to be not flushed and so stale an HTTP/2 stream. This bug was serious enough that we decided we should do a followup release ASAP.

The most important changes in this release are:

* Make sure we always flush window update frames in AbstractHttp2StreamChannel ([#10075](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10075))
* Use MacOSDnsServerAddressStreamProvider when on the classpath and we are running on MacOS ([#10079](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10079))
* Fix AssertionError in ScheduledFutureTask ([#10073](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10073))
* Preserve order when using alternate event loops ([#10069](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10069))

For the details and all changes, please browse our issue tracker for [4.1.47.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.1.47.Final+is%3Aclosed).
