title: 'Netty 4.1.31.Final released'
author: normanmaurer
---

Today we announce the release of netty 4.1.31.Final. This release contains bugfixes, some improvements and performance wins. Beside this one of the more interesting things included is the support of [TLSv1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446.txt) (either via Java 11 or netty-tcnative / netty-tcnative-boringssl-static). 

Please also check the `Important notes` section below before upgrading.

The most important changes are:

* Fix leak and corruption bugs in CompositeByteBuf ([#8438](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8438))
* Optimize AbstractByteBuf.getCharSequence() in US_ASCII case ([#8392](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8392))
* (fix) incorrect reachability assumption in ResourceLeakDetector ([#8410](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8410))
* Correctly detect if KeyManagerFactory is supported by OpenSSL even when sun.security.x509.* can not be accessed and bouncycastle is not on the classpath. ([#8415](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8415))
* Reduce overhead by ByteBufUtil.decodeString(...) which is used by `AbstractByteBuf.toString(...)` and `AbstractByteBuf.getCharSequence(...)` ([#8388](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8388))
* CompositeByteBuf.decompose(...) does not correctly slice content ([#8403](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8403))
* Allow to use TLSv1.3 with netty-tcnative withe java versions prior to 11 ([#8394](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8394))
* Add support for TLSv1.3 [#8293](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8293))
* Add support for boringssl and TLSv1.3 ([#8412](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8412))
* Ensure OpenSslEngine will not try to call SSL_free multiple times even when constructor throws [#8399](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8399))
* Add full JdkSslContext public constructor [#8389](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8389))
* Prevent NPE when attempting to set client key material with no alias [#8378](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8378))
* epoll_wait produces an EINVAL error since 4.1.30 [#8350](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/#8350))
* Correctly parse /etc/resolv.conf when contain multiple entries for searchdomain [#8351](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8351))
* Correctly decrement pending bytes when submitting AbstractWriteTask fails [#8349](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8349))
* Fix SelectableChannel support in NioEventLoop [#8344](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8344))
* Added option to do busy-wait on epoll [#8267](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8267))
* Ensure X509KeyManager methods are called on the correct time when using server-side and support more methods of ExtendedSSLSession [#8283](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8283))
* Do the same extended checks as the JDK when a X509TrustManager is used with the OpenSSL provider [#8307](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8307))

# Important notes

This section will give some more details about more important changes that either change behaviour or add support for some important feature.

## LeakDetector false-positives
This releases fixes a bug in `LeakDetector` which could cause false-positives in some cases when the JIT would re-order some operations and the GC would collect the reference in the same time when executing these. If you see any `LEAK:` reports that make no sense to you it may be caused by the bug that was present in prior releases. See ([#8410](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8410)) for more details.

## SslProvider.OPENSSL / SslProvider.OPENSSL_REFCNT and invalid ciphersuites
Prior to this release when using `SslProvider.OPENSSL` or `SslProvider.OPENSSL_REFCNT` and define the used ciphers by hand when configure the `SslContextBuilder` we just ignored not supported ciphers. This was changed in this release and from now on we will throw an exception. This is more consistent with what is done when using `SslProvider.JDK` and more correct. That said you may
need to adjust your ciphers depending what ciphers you configured before. See ([#8443](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8443)) for more details.

## TLSv1.3 support
[TLSv1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446.txt) was recently finalized as a standard. In this release we add support for it in various ways, when either of these is true:

* using Java11 or later
* using netty-tcnative (build against OpenSSL 1.1.1+) and Java8+
* using netty-tcnative-boringssl-static and Java8+.

That said TLSv1.3 is **not enabled by default** so if you want to use it you will need to explicit enable it by using `TLSv1.3` when configure your `SslContextBuilder` (like for example):

```java
SslContextBuilder.forClient().protocols("TLSv1.3") ....
```

To be able to do this for our native implementations you also need to ensure you use [netty-tcnative 2.0.19](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/netty/netty-tcnative/2.0.19.Final/) (compiled against OpenSSL 1.1.1+) or [netty-tcnative-boringssl-static 2.0.19](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/netty/netty-tcnative-boringssl-static/2.0.19.Final/).
