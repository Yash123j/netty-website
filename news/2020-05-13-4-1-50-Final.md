I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.50.Final after a bit more then one month of work. This is mainly a bug-fix release but also contain a few other goodies. Also this release firstly supports AARCH64 for the native epoll transport!

The most important changes in this release are:

* OpenSslSession.getLocalCertificates() and getLocalPrincipal() must return null on client side if mTLS is not used ([#10275](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10275))
* Select correct nameserver for CNAME ([#10272](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10272))
* Fix date format in headers to use 2-digit day of month as per RFC 2616 ([#10259](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10259))
* Add GlobalEventExecutor#addTask to BlockHound exceptions ([#10262](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10262))
* Add option to configure recycler delayed queue drop ratio ([#10255](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10255))
* Use `io.netty.recycler.ratio` directly ([#10253](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10253))
* Don't reuse ChannelPromise in WebSocketProtocolHandler ([#10248](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10248))
* Correctly handle WrappedCompositeByteBufs in addFlattenedComponents() ([#10247](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10247))
* Fix memory leak in HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder ([#10227](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10227))
* Detect CNAME loops in the CNAME cache while trying to resolve ([#10221](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10221))
* Dns resolver: honor resolv.conf timeout, rotate and attempts options ([#10207](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10207))
* Add check for DefaultFileRegion to calculate size of msg in AbstractTrafficShapingHandler ([#10215](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10215))
* HTTP2: Guard against multiple ctx.close(...) calls with the same ChannelPromise ([#10201](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10201))
